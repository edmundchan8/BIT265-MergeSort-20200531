My Mergesort code was taken from the website:
https://www.w3resource.com/csharp-exercises/searching-and-sorting-algorithm/searching-and-sorting-algorithm-exercise-7.php

My code can be run solely from the program.cs file contained within this folder.

This code was written in Visual Studios 2019, so may run best on that platform.
